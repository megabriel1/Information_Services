App to make donations

This app allows you to login based on the email and password of the existing users in the database. I didn't have time to develop an option to create new users from the app.

You can make donations with a credit card and check the information from a list connected to the database.

I attached the proyect called "App" developed in Netbeans 11.2, apache maven 3.6.3 and it runs on Wildfly Application Server 20.0.1.

There is a folder with two images to improve the user experience and a .jpg image of the entity relationship diagram.

You can find the database script called Donations and the MySQL jdbc Driver is also attached to make the connection to the database.

All the attachments can be found in the Master branch.
